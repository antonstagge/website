                    My name is Anton Stagge and I'm a social, outgoing and happy guy and I'm at the moment doing my masters studies in 
                    engineering and computer science at the Royal Institute of Technology. 
                    I've completed my bachelors degree, where I did a bachelors thesis about on the 
                    subject of applying machine learning techniques on Automated Guided Vehicles in 
                    Amazon warehouses. 
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>
                    I'm a very meticulous person that always strives after perfection. 
                    It is easy for me to learn new things quickly, but I always want, and try, to understand 
                    everything in detail. It is then that I can perform best, 
                    one could say that I'm a fullstack thinker. 
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>
                    I believe that my fascination and love for programming started when I was a child 
                    playing with legos, bionicles and puzzles as well as getting a liking for math early on.
                    I like to view programming as a big lego problem or puzzle. You have to connect the pieces together to 
                    build something new and exciting. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The transition from legos to actual programming took place when I studied a year at a college 
                    in Silicon Valley after graduation. Ever since my first introduction to programming in C++ course
                    there, I've devoted most of my waking hours to programming. Both the time I spend in school and the
                    countless of small side projects I've started up on myself. 
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>
                    I will always continue to learn more in the field and art of programming and computer science. 
                    I don not think my motivation to do so will ever die out, because the field is ever growing and 
                    there are so many things and skills that I want to learn and master. And the sensation you get when
                    creating something from scratch is too good to ever stop chasing after.
